Step-by-Step Instructions
Introduction to Monitoring Memory Utilization:

Understand that CPU utilization is straightforward to monitor using CloudWatch, but memory utilization requires a CloudWatch agent since it accesses system-level metrics.
Create an IAM Role:

Go to the IAM console.
Click on Roles > Create Role.
Select AWS service and choose EC2.
Attach the policies:
CloudWatchFullAccess
AmazonSSMFullAccess (needed for the System Manager).
Name the role (e.g., EC2CloudWatchRole) and create it.
Create a Parameter in the System Manager:

Navigate to System Manager > Parameter Store.
Click Create Parameter.
Specify the name, description, and data type.
In the Value field, paste the JSON document for fetching memory utilization.
Click Create Parameter.
Launch an EC2 Instance:

In the EC2 console, click Launch Instance.
Choose an Amazon Linux AMI and select your instance type.
Under Configure Instance, select the IAM role created earlier.
In the User Data section, add the commands to install the CloudWatch agent and fetch the configuration from the Parameter Store.
Review and launch the instance.
Installing and Configuring the CloudWatch Agent:

Follow the commands in the user data to:
Download the CloudWatch agent from AWS S3.
Unzip and install the agent.
Fetch the configuration from the Parameter Store.
Verify the Installation:

Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
Check the status of the CloudWatch agent to ensure it is running.
View Memory Utilization in CloudWatch:

Open the CloudWatch console.
Go to Metrics and find the CWAgent namespace.
Select your instance ID to view memory utilization metrics.
Create an Alarm for Memory Utilization:

In CloudWatch, navigate to Alarms > Create Alarm.
Select the memory utilization metric.
Set the threshold (e.g., greater than 90%).
Configure notifications if needed and create the alarm.
Monitor Alarm States:

Refresh your alarms to check their states. Initially, they may show as insufficient data.
Once data is available, the alarm state will change based on the configured thresholds.
Conclusion:

You can now monitor memory utilization of your EC2 instance and set alarms based on thresholds.
