# Aws-Memory-Monitoring
Features:
I set up an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux 2, making sure it was secure by customizing the security group and limiting SSH access. I also created a new user with sudo rights, disabled root login, and required key-based SSH authentication for increased security. Finally, I configured CloudWatch alarms to track CPU usage and send alerts if it goes over a set limit.
